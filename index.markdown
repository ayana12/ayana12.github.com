# [Ayana 12][self]

Ayana is a two day technical event hosted at PESIT, Bangalore, featuring Technical talks by leading Open-Source contributors, and a ‘No-Talk-All-Action’ 24 hours Hackathon for the innovation enthusiasts.

The Department of Computer Science, PESIT in collaboration with PES Open Source Community is elated to announce Ayana-2012, a two day Hackathon to be hosted on 28th and 29th of April, 2012. This event will mark the initiation of Ayana in the history of PESIT.

 

##Hackathon : Come, C, Conquer
Here is a call for all the students, developers, and designers across India to be a part of round the clock Hackathon challenge. The event gives an opportunity to showcase the innovation in you and collaborate with the people around in a fun environment.

Hackathon is not about network hacks, rather it’s to simulate a bunch of ideas in any domain (and language!) of your interest , generate some prototypes, end up with some useful code, and also get everyone thinking about unleashing their creative best.

##Where?


##The Organizers
###About the Institution
PES Institute of Technology, Bengaluru was established in 1988 by renowned educationist Dr. M.R. Doreswamy as the first engineering college under the PES Group of Institutions. The institute attained autonomy in the year 2007. It offers Undergraduate, Postgraduate, and Doctoral degree programmes in most disciplines of Engineering & Management. PES today is a brand by itself, providing the best quality education and is one of the most sought after institutions by students and parents across the country. Its vision has been to make the students professionally superior and ethically strong global manpower.

###About the Department
Department of Computer Science and Engineering at PESIT was established in the year 1988. The aggressive academic rigor in the autonomous program with a high quality curriculum designed especially in association with highly accomplished professionals from Industry and Research Organizations has rendered this program as one of the most sought after undergraduate programs in the country. The department has very highly accomplished faculty, including Ph.D.s from premier institutes in India and abroad. This rich global exposure ofthe faculty to the state of the art technologies in various domains has helped the students to enjoy the best learning experience. Owing to very innovative initiatives introduced into the undergraduate and postgraduate programs, students graduating from the CSE department, get into the best of the IT Industries.
Having reached a significant milestone in offering very high quality UG and PG programs, the next natural migration is in the research domain. With most faculty members being research active, the department has achieved a significant research status in terms of quality Journal/Conference publications. The department takes pride in engaging with research organizations and the corporate world in terms of funded projects. The efforts of the faculty have brought in research projects from organizations/agencies such as AICTE, VTU, SAP Labs, and Intel. the Ph.D. related activities at the Research Centre of the CSE department.
With this strong focus on research, there is a new phenomenon of the passion exhibited by UG and PG students to involve in funded research projects. These initiatives have created opportunities for our students to collaborate with premier foreign universities even during their UG/PG studies. The department will continue its strive to accelerate its research initiatives which will naturally feed into quality teaching.

###PES Open Source Community
An open source initiative undertaken by the alumni and students of PESIT, Bangalore. It aims to popularize open source,come out with new hacks and projects and spread the word on software freedom and liberty.

Apart from creating awareness about the importance of FOSS in day-to-day lives, the community has been striving hard to provide new developers to the larger open source community by inspiring budding engineers to develop for open source, to be at the leading edge of advanced technologies by being part of large scale open source projects.

The community has been engaging FOSS enthusiasts of the PES family by conducting workshops, tech talks and guiding them with their projects. The session on the Google Summer of Code saw about 100 eager students and was a roaring success.

Catch the community on IRC : #pes-os on Freenode or their Facebook group.

##FAQs

###What are Hackathons?
Hackathons are free-form, informal coding events. Mostly, they are about building cool projects and working with a wide range of enthusiasts. It has nothing to do with network related hacking or password cracking. It is a misnomer.

###What is a hack?
There is  a famous quote by Eric S Raymond,

“Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite”

In a more generic sense, an ideal hack is something that uses the existing frameworks to build something new, something that wasn’t thought of before. So, this definition expands the domain of a hack to everything ranging from writing kernel drivers to tinkering with your old radio.

Please note that a hack is different from network penetration. To know the difference, read this article

###What are the resources / APIs / frameworks that I can use?
This is an open hack event i.e. you have complete freedom to use any tools of your choice. You may develop anything from a mobile application to your own motherboard; the only restriction being that it should have been initiated and must end within the period of the hackathon.

###How many people to a team?
We want to avoid large groups of people coding a single project, as this leads to miscommunication and complications within the team that means the project doesn’t get finished. We have restricted the team size to a maximum of three.

I don’t have a team. Can I hook up with other people and form my team on-spot?
Sure! We will be there on the day to help you pair up with like-minded people who are teamless too. Don’t let such mundane barriers stop you!

###Is there a limitation on participation?
There’s no limitation on the tech talks. But due to organizational reasons, we are limiting the number of total participants for the hackathon to the first 200 who apply, which makes for roughly 60 – 70 teams. So apply at the earliest to book a place amongst those bean bags.

###Can a team submit more than one project?
Unfortunately, no. While we appreciate the idea of getting to see more than one awesome hack from our enthusiastic participants, since this would bring further complications in the criteria for evaluation, we are restricting the entries per team to only one.

Brr… All this sounds beyond me!!
Thinking so would be the biggest mistake you can do. Consider that almost every other participant would be around the same age as you, and would be having similar skill sets, having studied almost the same subjects. There is no need to have any sort of apprehensions.

###How should I prepare?
You don’t need to. The ideal hackathon is one where you come to the place, learn something new and develop a nice, neat little hack / application using your newly acquired skills. However this is not a restriction; you can come prepared with a bunch of ideas in your saddle.

###What should I bring with me?
You should be armed with anything you need to build your hack ( iPhone, android etc if it’s a mobile app; your laptop; circuit boards if it’s a hardware hack ) We will provide bandwidth and keep you well fed for the period of the hack (Note: You are allowed to bring your own data cards if you so prefer, and we recommend you carry your data cards if possible ) and don’t forget that toothbrush.

###Who owns the code I write?
You do, unless you are using something that belongs to someone else. We’ll be needing the complete source code that you’ve written for evaluation purposes, but the ownership will, of course, be completely and indisputably yours.

I can’t stay for the whole 24 hours. Can I still apply?
Of course. We realize that 24 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments or even want to shower or sleep. We do strongly encourage you to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and for the final few hours for the presentations and judging. But it is recommended that you hack away for the entire duration.

###I’m not a student anymore. Can I still participate?
Of course you can. In keeping with the spirit of open hack, we keep absolutely no limitations as far as academics are concerned. Our jury will be taking all factors into consideration to make sure that the evaluation is fair.

###Do I need to bring my own laptop?
Not if you are attending only the tech talks (Although it is recommended that you do). But for the hackathon, you’ll have  to get your own laptops. Please bring anything you’ll need for your hack (though it’s fine if you share equipment with a teammate).

###Finally, is it safe to spend a whole night in your campus?
Yes. We have top-class security and the campus will be fully locked down on the night of the hackathon. You need not worry about having any kind of trouble as long as you are in our campus.
